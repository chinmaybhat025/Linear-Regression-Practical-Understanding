# Linear-Regression-Practical-Understanding

Linear Regression Works on Some Basic Assumptions:-

  1)  The sample data used to fit the model is representative of the population
  2)  The relationship between X and the mean of Y is linear
  3)  The variance of the residual is the same for any value of X (homoscedasticity)
  4)  Observations are independent of each other
  5)  For any value of X, Y is normally distributed.
